This is a simple trivia app in python.

The backend is not provided, but use is simple yet effective. To play, simply start the app, use the category, number, type, and difficulty fields to filter questions, preview if desired, and then click play. If chosen, a timer will automatically begin to count down on each slide when the question and options are displayed.
